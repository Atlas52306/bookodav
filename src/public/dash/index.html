      <h3>
        What is this ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        booko-dav is a play on "books",
        <a href="https://koreader.rocks/" target="_blank">"koreader"</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV"> "WebDAV"</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is primarily designed to be a WebDAV to transfer and store books
        between your pc, phone, and ereader. (in my case a jailbroken kindle). It is selfhostable and <strong> MOSTLY
          FREE</strong>
        <em>(10GB to be exact)</em>. <a href="">See Pricing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookodav is a self hostable WebDAV server. It uses cloudflare workers to archive this,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/"> its a pretty
          cool tech if
          you
          want to read about it.</a>

      <h3>
        Why is this ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For fun, there are more WebDAVs out there, I just wanted to add my own version, I also wanted this geared to
        the ebook community, and to be easy to deploy and cheap to use.

        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="http://dash.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>
          <p>Check it whenever you can, monitor your stored size, requests, payments etc.</p>
          <p>Also prefer using it over this sites view docs table, view docs is provided as a convinience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">Cloudflare r2 pricing</a>
          <p>R2 is the storage where everying thing you send gets stored. YOU GET ONLY 10GB FREE</p>
          <p>Bookodav does heavy caching in order to mitigate bills. Every list call on your device is cached for a
            week,
            unless you upload a new file or delete a file.</p>
          <p>This can sometimes cause inconsistencies, but I find it very minimal</p>
          <p>Do not that r2 on its own is very cheap, and even without the cache it is very unlikly you will exhaust it
            with just ebooks</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/">Cloudflare workers
            pricing</a>
          <p>Workers are essential the computers that go back and forth from your database and devide</p>
          <p>These are also quire cheap with 100,000 per day, so you fet to make 100,000 requests per day, upload
            download
            delete and view all count as requets</p>
          <p>Again very unlikly you will exhaust this single handedly</p>
