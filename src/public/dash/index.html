        <p>Check it whenever you can, monitor your stored size, requests, payments etc.</p>
        <p>Also prefer using it over this sites view docs table, view docs is provided as a convinience.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">Cloudflare r2 pricing</a>
        <p>R2 is the storage where everying thing you send gets stored. YOU GET ONLY 10GB FREE</p>
        <p>Bookodav does heavy caching in order to mitigate bills. Every list call on your device is cached for a week,
          unless you upload a new file or delete a file.</p>
        <p>This can sometimes cause inconsistencies, but I find it very minimal</p>
        <p>Do not that r2 on its own is very cheap, and even without the cache it is very unlikly you will exhaust it
          with just ebooks</p>

      <article>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/">Cloudflare workers
          pricing</a>
        <p>Workers are essential the computers that go back and forth from your database and devide</p>
        <p>These are also quire cheap with 100,000 per day, so you fet to make 100,000 requests per day, upload download
          delete and view all count as requets</p>
        <p>Again very unlikly you will exhaust this single handedly</p>
